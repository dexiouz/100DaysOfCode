###Day0 August 13, Monday

**Today's work**: Working on setting up repo and initializing my workspaces.

**Thoughts**: Setup new repo , git init etc

**Link to work**: No project at the momentgit 


###Day1 August 14, Tuesday

**Today's work**:Crash course on es6 .

**Thoughts**: Focus is on the **var, let and const**.
The *var* variables can be accessed after they are declaredYou can as well acess that they have been declared. The same is not true for the **let and const.**
var variables are function scoped, but if there is no function, the var is scoped to the entire window.
**Let and const** are block scoped. This gives better flexibility than the var.Blocks are denoted with curly brackets. Let variables can be updated, const variables can,t be updated.

Discovered the object.freeze() that allows you to make an object const immutable.

Dived into arrow functions. Arrow functions are anonymous functions.But you can put them in a variable.
 
###Day2 August 15, Wednesday
**Today's work**: Continued with es6 functionalities:

**Thoughts**: There is such a thing as 'console.table()?' OMG!!
With arrow functions, the keyword 'this' is not bound to that actual function.
When you shouldn't use arrow functions:
1) when you need to add a prototype method;
2)when you need a method to bind to an object ;
3)when you need arguments object;
4)When using event listeners

###Day3 August 16, Thursday
**Today's work**: Still on es6. Solved arrow function exercises to wrap it up.
 Dived into **template literals**. OMG!!! template literals are cute.

###Day5 August 19, Sunday
**Today's work**: Still on es6. Did alot of cool stuff with template-literals such as tagging template literals; There were  two basic manipulations.

###Day6 August 21 Tuesday
**Today's work**:Worked with the  New string methods of ES6. They are **.startsWith(), .endsWith(), .includes(), .repeat()**
Dived into **Destructuring objects and arrays and functions**;
In destructuring, curly brackets are used whenn you destructure from an object but normal braces are used when you destructure from an array.

###Day7 August 22 Wedneday
**Today's work**:The **for-of-loop** is used to loop through any type of data that is iterable. Used the for-in-loop to loop through an object.

The **for-of-loop** is used to loop through any type of data that is iterable. Iterable is anything that can be looped over such as an array, map , set , generators etc. Disadvantage of the **forEach loop** is that you cant abort or continue the loop; you cant skip. The **for-in loop** mostly returns the index, to get the items, you use the index e.g **console.log(cuts[index])**
**The for-of-loop** is the best, can be used for any type of data except objects. You can abort or continue the loop with if statements and you can also skip. To derive the index, call the .entries() method to derive an iterator.
Another useful example is iterating over arguments. For instance when you don't know how many arguments are being passed. The argument proto is object so you may have to convert it to an arrya forst but woth the for-of-loop you dont have to convert it to an array.

You cannot iterate over an object but you can use for-in loop to do some things. The object.keys(object) will take in an object and return the keys.

**the array.from()** takes something that is array(ish) and turns it into a full array. Array(ish) means it has some of the methods of an array such as length etc but not all array props.

###Day8 and Day 9 August 23 and 24 Thursday and Friday
**Today's work**Read array methods on the **javascript Ninja TextBook.** 
ES6 array methods. The array.from() and aray.of(). Found out, array.from() takes a second argument which is a map function which allows us to modify the data as we are creating the array. 
**Link to work**: [github]('github.com/dexiouz/100DaysOfCode')


###Day12 
**Today's work**: New ES6 Array method .find() is a callback function that returns true or false until you actually find it, works better with loops. To find multiple try the array.filter which returns an array of objects.
The .findIndex() gets the index of the element, for instance if you want ot delete it.

Array.some() and Array.every() are not actually part of ES6 but they are not widely used.
They check through an array to see i sme of the data or all of the data meet what you're looking for.They both return true or false

###Day13 
**Focus:** spread-operator
**Today's work**:The spread operator takes every single item from an iterable eg arrays, dom, objects, string and apply it to the containing element.
You can also copy an array without overriding the contents of the main array when you edit the copied array.
**Link to work**: [github]('github.com/dexiouz/100DaysOfCode')

###Day14
**Focus:** spread-operator
**Today's work**:Used spread operators to spread into a function. And as an alternative to array.from(). To remove an object from an array of objects.
**Link to work**: [github]('github.com/dexiouz/100DaysOfCode')

###Day15
**Focus:** The rest-param and object literals
**Today's work**:The rest-param is the opposite of the spreaad operator; where the spread operator takes an array andunpacks it into multiple array, the rest param takes multiple items and packs them into a single array. Two cases where rest params are used are in arrays and in destructuring situations.

Another focus was on object literals and used in several cases

###Day17
**Focus:** Flexbox.
Set up flexbox environment , created html with few divs, linked css stylesheet, used flex display property on  the divs. 
**Link to work**: [github]('github.com/dexiouz/100DaysOfCode')

###Day18
**Focus:** Flexbox.
Flex-Direction: The 'flex-direction: row' the default of any flex container spans the content vertically to hit the height of the container. It stacks them side by side.
The 'flex-direction:column' instead stacks the contents vertically on top of each other. 
 

When defining the flex-direction as row or column, we have two accesses which are the main accesses like justify-content and align-items. 
The main access when it is row, is from left to right. If it is column, it goes from top to bottom.

There is also flex-direction: row-reverse or column reverse which are the cross accesses, the access starts in reverse. They are the cross accesses
 

Flex-wrap:
Suppose the flex elements have total widths bigger than your screen size, the 'flex-wrap: wrap'property comes in to evenly stretch  the elements in the screen. 
Suppose I give each box a width of 300px which is a total of 300px*10, that is 300px. The problem is, my screen is not 300px wide.
Here flex tries to share the flex elements evenly on the screen.
Thats where we apply the flex-wrap on the flex container.


However, there is also the wrap-reverse for cross access.
Sometimes there appears additional spaces on the screen unused by the flex items ; in this case you can fill the space by setting  the width: 33.33333%. It works, lol.

But if you switch the flex-direction to column, things kind of change, this is essentially because of the 100vh height we provided, it hits the height and starts a new vertical wrap. But using 'min-height: 100vh' causes the flex elements to overflow with wrap so you can scroll from to)p to bottom.

Lets revert back to flex direction row and gives the elements a margin of 10px, it breaks. 
To solve it, use width: calc(33.33333%-20px).
Using padding or border properties gives you something interesting too.

###Day19
**Focus:** Flexbox.
Flex box ordering is a way to move the order of DOM elements without moving them in the DOM.
The flex:1 property distributes the elements equally on the screen. 
Order takes a number and pushes the target element further down the screen to the right . The default order value is 0. Order is good especially for responsiveness.
Order also takes negative values but instead pushes the target element to the left.

###Day20
**Focus:** Flexbox.
Taking an overview of flexbox from Netninja.
Building a good website requires painstaking care in positioning elements. Such properties like position: relative or absolute which takes values are used for positioning to get elemnts where we want them to be. 
 To create grids, one needed the float property, even for layouts or navigation systems, the float property was the ideal thing.
 The fixed height property was needed for giving columns same height.
 These methods are tiring, this is where the css flexbox comes in.

What the flexbox? 
 Flexbox is a CSS display type designed for crafting CSS layouts much easier.

With CSS flexbox you can easily control the position, size and spacing of elements relative to each other and to their parent element.

And the better part? It works great responsively.               

Basically flexbox works like so: Take an element such as a div, give it a classname or id, then give a display property of flex and that is all, every of its direct children becomes flex elements and essentially becomes more flexible and we can basically control how they shrink and how they grow as well give the spacing between them.

Some benefits of using flexbox:
Helps to create navigation bars and menus very easily without having to use floats or worried about collapsing elements.

We can also create Grid elements really easily and Bar charts too. Again creating equal height columns becomes easier with flexbox.

For browsers which do not fully support flexbox such as IE8, we use modernizr. A modernizr is a javascript library that basically dictates which browser a user is using to view your site. And when it dictates that the browser does not support flexbox, it creates classes which we can use to style the elements specific to that web browser.

###Day21
**Focus:** Flexbox.
Basically when you give a display:flex property to an element, every direct child of that element becomes a flex item and we can then control their behaviour or the behaviour of the parent element.Using flexbox properties we can determine how these flex items grow or shrink relative to each other or whether they should stacked side by side or in colum or row form.

Looked at flex over float.
Next was flex-grow.
