###Day0 August 13, Monday

**Today's work**: Working on setting up repo and initializing my workspaces.

**Thoughts**: Setup new repo , git init etc

**Link to work**: No project at the momentgit 


###Day1 August 14, Tuesday

**Today's work**:Crash course on es6 .

**Thoughts**: Focus is on the **var, let and const**.
The *var* variables can be accessed after they are declaredYou can as well acess that they have been declared. The same is not true for the **let and const.**
var variables are function scoped, but if there is no function, the var is scoped to the entire window.
**Let and const** are block scoped. This gives better flexibility than the var.Blocks are denoted with curly brackets. Let variables can be updated, const variables can,t be updated.

Discovered the object.freeze() that allows you to make an object const immutable.

Dived into arrow functions. Arrow functions are anonymous functions.But you can put them in a variable.
 
###Day2 August 15, Wednesday
**Today's work**: Continued with es6 functionalities:

**Thoughts**: There is such a thing as 'console.table()?' OMG!!
With arrow functions, the keyword 'this' is not bound to that actual function.
When you shouldn't use arrow functions:
1) when you need to add a prototype method;
2)when you need a method to bind to an object ;
3)when you need arguments object;
4)When using event listeners

###Day3 August 16, Thursday
**Today's work**: Still on es6. Solved arrow function exercises to wrap it up.
 Dived into **template literals**. OMG!!! template literals are cute.

###Day4 August 17, Friday
**Today's work**: Still on es6. Spent the early hours manipulating template literals, nesting and a=mbedding template literals.s

###Day5 August 19, Sunday
**Today's work**: Still on es6. Did alot of cool stuff with template-literals such as tagging template literals; There were  two basic manipulations.

###Day6 August 21 Tuesday
**Today's work**:Worked with the  New string methods of ES6. They are **.startsWith(), .endsWith(), .includes(), .repeat()**
Dived into **Destructuring objects and arrays and functions**;
In destructuring, curly brackets are used whenn you destructure from an object but normal braces are used when you destructure from an array.

###Day7 August 22 Wedneday
**Today's work**:The **for-of-loop** is used to loop through any type of data that is iterable. Used the for-in-loop to loop through an object.

The **for-of-loop** is used to loop through any type of data that is iterable. Iterable is anything that can be looped over such as an array, map , set , generators etc. Disadvantage of the **forEach loop** is that you cant abort or continue the loop; you cant skip. The **for-in loop** mostly returns the index, to get the items, you use the index e.g **console.log(cuts[index])**
**The for-of-loop** is the best, can be used for any type of data except objects. You can abort or continue the loop with if statements and you can also skip. To derive the index, call the .entries() method to derive an iterator.
Another useful example is iterating over arguments. For instance when you don't know how many arguments are being passed. The argument proto is object so you may have to convert it to an arrya forst but woth the for-of-loop you dont have to convert it to an array.

You cannot iterate over an object but you can use for-in loop to do some things. The object.keys(object) will take in an object and return the keys.

**the array.from()** takes something that is array(ish) and turns it into a full array. Array(ish) means it has some of the methods of an array such as length etc but not all array props.
