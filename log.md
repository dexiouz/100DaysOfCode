###Day0 August 13, Monday

**Today's work**: Working on setting up repo and initializing my workspaces.

**Thoughts**: Setup new repo , git init etc

**Link to work**: No project at the momentgit 


###Day1 August 14, Tuesday

**Today's work**:Crash course on es6 .

**Thoughts**: Focus is on the **var, let and const**.
The *var* variables can be accessed after they are declaredYou can as well acess that they have been declared. The same is not true for the **let and const.**
var variables are function scoped, but if there is no function, the var is scoped to the entire window.
**Let and const** are block scoped. This gives better flexibility than the var.Blocks are denoted with curly brackets. Let variables can be updated, const variables can,t be updated.

Discovered the object.freeze() that allows you to make an object const immutable.

Dived into arrow functions. Arrow functions are anonymous functions.But you can put them in a variable.
 
###Day2 August 15, Wednesday
**Today's work**: Continued with es6 functionalities:

**Thoughts**: There is such a thing as 'console.table()?' OMG!!
With arrow functions, the keyword 'this' is not bound to that actual function.
When you shouldn't use arrow functions:
1) when you need to add a prototype method;
2)when you need a method to bind to an object ;
3)when you need arguments object;
4)When using event listeners
