**Today's work**:Crash course on es6 .

**Thoughts**: Focus is on the **var, let and const**.
The *var* variables can be accessed after they are declaredYou can as well acess that they have been declared. The same is not true for the **let and const.**
var variables are function scoped, but if there is no function, the var is scoped to the entire window.
**Let and const** are block scoped. This gives better flexibility than the var.Blocks are denoted with curly brackets. Let variables can be updated, const variables can,t be updated.

Discovered the object.freeze() that allows you to make an object const immutable.

Dived into arrow functions. Arrow functions are anonymous functions.But you can put them in a variable.
