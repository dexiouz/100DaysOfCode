The importance of upstream is to updated with the current repo incase you left off pushing your projects some weeks ago.


After two weeks
$git checkout master      //
$ git fetch upstream      //to pull information in upstream... pull their own master
$ git merge upstream/master  // update my own master with their master
$ git merge master myBranchName   //update my local branch
$git checkout myBranchName    // switched to my master
$git add .
$git commit -m "my commit message"
$git push origin myBranchName
